# Expense Tracker Web App

This is a simple expense tracking web application I built using **Flask**, **MongoDB**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of this project was to create a practical tool to record and manage expenses, and also to learn how to build REST APIs with Flask and connect them to a frontend.

## Features

- Add new expenses (name, amount, category)
- View all your expenses in a list
- Delete unwanted expenses
- Total amount calculation (coming soon)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask Framework)
- **Database**: MongoDB (local setup)

# **Future Improvements**

User authentication
Edit existing expense entries
Filter by category/date
Deployed version (maybe using Render or Heroku)
